Given a sorted array arr[] with possibly duplicate elements, the task is to find indexes of 
the first and last occurrences of an element x in the given array. 

Examples: 

Input : arr[] = {1, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 67, 123, 125}, x = 5
Output : First Occurrence = 2
         Last Occurrence = 5

Input : arr[] = {1, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 123, 125 }, x = 7
Output : First Occurrence = 6
         Last Occurrence = 6
*/

// Solution:

/*
The idea to solve this problem is iterate on the elements of given array and check given 
elements in an array and keep track of first and last occurrence of the found elementâ€™s index.
Below are the steps to implement the above idea:

Run a for loop and for i = 0 to n-1
Take first = -1 and last = -1 
When we find an element first time then we update first = i 
We always update last=i whenever we find the element.
We print first and last.
*/

// Function for finding first and last occurrence
// of an elements
function findFirstAndLast(arr,x)
{
  let n = arr.length;
  let first = -1, last = -1;
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (x != arr[i])
      continue;
    if (first == -1)
      first = i;
    last = i;
  }
  if (first != -1) {
    document.write("First Occurrence = " + first + "<br>");
    document.write("Last Occurrence = " + last + "<br>");
  }
  else
    document.write("Not Found");
}

let arr = [1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 8 ];
let x = 8;
findFirstAndLast(arr, x);

// Time Complexity: O(n) 
// Auxiliary Space: O(1)
