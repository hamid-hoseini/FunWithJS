Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, 
and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].
Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
*/

// Solution: 

/*
Brute Force Approach:

A simple approach is to start from the first interval and compare it with all other intervals for overlapping, 
if it overlaps with any other interval, then remove the other interval from the list and merge the other into 
the first interval. Repeat the same steps for the remaining intervals after the first. This approach cannot be 
implemented in better than O(n^2) time.

// An interval has a start time and end time

// overlapping intervals and prints the result

/*
Merge Overlapping Intervals using Sorting (Optimized Approach):
To solve this problem optimally we have to first sort the intervals according to the starting time. 
Once we have the sorted intervals, we can combine all intervals in a linear traversal. The idea is, 
in sorted array of intervals, if interval[i] doesnâ€™t overlap with interval[i-1], then interval[i+1] 
cannot overlap with interval[i-1] because starting time of interval[i+1] must be greater than or equal to interval[i].
*/

/*
Follow the steps mentioned below to implement the approach:

Sort all intervals in increasing order of start time.
Traverse sorted intervals starting from the first interval, 
Do the following for every interval.
If the current interval is not the first interval and it overlaps with the previous interval,
 then merge it with the previous interval. Keep doing it while the interval overlaps with the previous one.         
 Otherwise, Add the current interval to the output list of intervals.
