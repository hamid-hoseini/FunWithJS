Given an m x n matrix, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

Example 1:
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]

output: 1->2->3->6->9->8->7->4->5

Example2:

Input:  {
        {1,  2,  3,  4},
        {5,  6,  7,  8},
        {9,  10, 11, 12},
        {13, 14, 15, 16}
        }
Output: 1 2 3 4 8 12 16 15 14 13 9 5 6 7 11 10 
Explanation: The output is matrix in spiral format.

// Solution 1:

/*
Follow the given steps to solve the problem:

Let the array have R rows and C columns
seen[r] denotes that the cell on the r-th row and c-th column was previously visited. Our current position is (r, c), 
facing direction di, and we want to visit R x C total cells.
As we move through the matrix, our candidateâ€™s next position is (cr, cc). 
If the candidate is in the bounds of the matrix and unseen, then it becomes our next position; otherwise, our next 
position is the one after performing a clockwise turn
