// Coding Interview Question

/*
Given a linked list and an integer N, the task is to delete the Nth node from the end of the given linked list.
 Examples:  

Input: 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 7 -> NULL, N = 1 
Output: 
The created linked list is: 
2 3 1 7 
The linked list after deletion is: 
2 3 1

Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> NULL, N = 4 
Output: 
The created linked list is: 
1 2 3 4 
The linked list after deletion is: 
2 3 4 
*/

// Solution1:

/*
Let K be the total nodes in the linked list.
Observation: The Nth node from the end is (K-N+1)th node from the beginning.
So the problem simplifies down to that we have to find  (K-N+1)th node from the beginning.
One way of doing it is to find the length (K) of the linked list in one pass and then in the 
second pass move (K-N+1) step from the beginning to reach the Nth node from the end.
To do it in one pass. Letâ€™s take the first pointer and move N step from the beginning. 
Now the first pointer is (K-N+1) steps away from the last node, 
which is the same number of steps the second pointer require to move from the beginning to reach the Nth node from the end.
